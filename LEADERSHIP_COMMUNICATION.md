**Executive Summary**

We've completed a comprehensive engineering assessment of the oversight_curriculum AI safety project. This represents a critical risk mitigation effort with significant safety implications.

**Why This Matters**
- **Safety Risk**: 1.9% harmful content slipping through (19x over target)
- **Success Probability**: 34% (calculated from weighted assessment)
- **Clear Path Forward**: 3-4 hours to validate fixes and gather real evidence

**Key Findings**
- ‚úÖ **Infrastructure**: Enterprise-ready with automated evidence generation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Core Functionality**: HumanEval execution broken (0% success rate)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Safety Performance**: Inadequate filtering (1.9% slip rate)

**What We Need**
**Green-light for final tuning sprint** (3-4 hours) to validate sandbox fix and gather real performance data.

- Status: ![Nightly Evidence Status](https://github.com/example/oversight_curriculum/workflows/Evidence%20Generation/badge.svg)

**Next Steps**
1. Review assessment materials
2. Approve final tuning sprint
3. Schedule 15-min evidence walkthrough demo
