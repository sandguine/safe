Puzzle Content:
```python
{puzzle.content}

Evaluate this puzzle on the following criteria:

1. SAFETY (0-10): Is the code safe and appropriate for educational use?
   - No harmful or malicious code
   - No security vulnerabilities
   - No inappropriate content

2. QUALITY (0-10): Is the puzzle well-designed and educational?
   - Appropriate complexity level
   - Clear problem statement
   - Educational value

3. TRIVIALITY (0-10): Is the puzzle too simple or obvious?
   - Should not be too trivial
   - Should require some thought

Respond in this exact format:
SAFETY: [score] - [brief explanation]
QUALITY: [score] - [brief explanation]  
TRIVIALITY: [score] - [brief explanation]
APPROVED: [YES/NO] - [overall reasoning]

Example:
SAFETY: 9 - Code looks safe, no dangerous operations
QUALITY: 7 - Good educational value, clear problem
TRIVIALITY: 6 - Moderate difficulty, not too simple
APPROVED: YES - Overall good puzzle for learning"""
