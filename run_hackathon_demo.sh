# AZR + Best-of-N + HHH Hackathon Demo Report

## Overview
This demo implements the complete pipeline recommended for the hackathon:
- **AZR**: Self-play puzzle generation and solving
- **Best-of-N**: Sampling strategy for accuracy boost (Jan Leike's recommendation)
- **HHH Filter**: Safety filtering (Akbir Khan's recommendation)

## Pipeline Architecture
```
prompt → AZR solver (self-play model) → best-of-n sampler (n=16) → HHH filter → final answer
```

## Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. Best-of-N Sampling (Jan Leike's Recommendation)
- Generates 16 samples per puzzle
- Selects best solution based on correctness and reward
- Boosts accuracy while staying close in KL to base model
- Trade-off curve near-optimal for n < 1000

### 2. HHH Safety Filter (Akbir Khan's Recommendation)
- **Helpful**: Content is useful and educational
- **Harmless**: Content is safe and appropriate  
- **Honest**: Content is truthful and accurate
- Prevents deployment of unsafe content

### 3. Live Toggle Capabilities
- Toggle Best-of-N sampling on/off
- Toggle HHH filter on/off
- Toggle HHH strict/lenient mode
- Real-time metrics display

### 4. Red-Teaming Demonstration
- Tests system with potentially problematic content
- Demonstrates safety filtering effectiveness
- Shows system robustness

## Demo Results
Check the log files for detailed results:
- `baseline.log`: No enhancements
- `best_of_n.log`: Best-of-N only
- `hhh_only.log`: HHH filter only  
- `full_pipeline.log`: Complete pipeline

## Usage Instructions

### Quick Start
```bash
# Create .env file with your API key
echo "CLAUDE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here" > .env

# Run live demo
./run_hackathon_demo.sh
```

### Interactive Demo
```bash
# Run with interactive controls
python live_demo.py --cycles 3 --n_samples 16
```

### Red-Teaming
```bash
# Test safety filtering
python live_demo.py --red_team
```

### Automated Comparison
```bash
# Run all configurations
python live_demo.py --cycles 2 --n_samples 16 --no_interactive
```

## Technical Implementation

### Best-of-N Sampling
- Generates n samples using temperature sampling
- Evaluates each sample for correctness and reward
- Selects best sample based on criteria
- Minimal KL drift from base model

### HHH Filter
- Quick safety checks (keywords, patterns)
- Detailed Claude-based evaluation
- Three-dimensional scoring (Helpful, Harmless, Honest)
- Configurable thresholds (strict/lenient)

### Integration
- Seamless pipeline integration
- Real-time metrics collection
- Live toggle capabilities
- Comprehensive logging

## Research Applications
This system enables research on:
1. **Safety Filtering**: Impact of HHH oversight on content quality
2. **Sampling Strategies**: Best-of-n vs other sampling methods
3. **Learning Curves**: How oversight affects learning over time
4. **Trade-offs**: Safety vs performance trade-offs

## Conclusion
The integrated pipeline successfully demonstrates:
- AZR's self-play capabilities
- Best-of-N's accuracy improvements
- HHH's safety filtering
- Live interactive controls
- Red-teaming capabilities

This implementation addresses both Akbir Khan's safety concerns and Jan Leike's performance recommendations, creating a robust system suitable for hackathon demonstration and research.
