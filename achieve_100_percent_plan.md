# Plan to Achieve 100% Implementation for All Claims

## Current Status Analysis

Based on the latest results, here are the specific gaps preventing 100% implementation:

### 1. Better Accuracy (85% → 100%)

**Issue**: Pass@1 is 0.0 for both baseline and oversight
**Root Cause**: HumanEval evaluation logic not working properly
**Solution**: Fix evaluation parsing and execution

### 2. Lower Harm (95% → 100%)

**Issue**: 0% refusal rate (needs ≥80%)
**Root Cause**: Safety filter not properly rejecting harmful prompts
**Solution**: Implement proper safety filtering logic

### 3. KL Divergence (85% → 100%)

**Issue**: "Insufficient data for KL analysis"
**Root Cause**: Need actual solution distributions to compare
**Solution**: Generate multiple solutions and calculate KL divergence

### 4. Self-Alignment (85% → 100%)

**Issue**: "Insufficient data for self-alignment analysis"
**Root Cause**: Need baseline vs oversight alignment scores
**Solution**: Implement proper self-alignment measurement

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Fix HumanEval Evaluation (Better Accuracy)

1. Debug the evaluation logic in `humaneval_integration.py`
2. Ensure proper test execution and result parsing
3. Test with known working solutions

### Step 2: Implement Proper Safety Filtering (Lower Harm)

1. Fix the HHH filter to actually reject harmful prompts
2. Set proper thresholds for refusal
3. Test with harmful vs harmless prompts

### Step 3: Enable KL Divergence Analysis

1. Generate multiple solutions per problem
2. Calculate probability distributions
3. Implement KL divergence measurement

### Step 4: Implement Self-Alignment Measurement

1. Calculate alignment scores for baseline vs oversight
2. Measure E[R(x)·Safe(x)] improvement
3. Validate statistical significance

### Step 5: Comprehensive Testing

1. Run full implementation with fixes
2. Validate all claims meet 100% criteria
3. Generate final report

## Success Criteria for 100%

- **Better Accuracy**: Pass@1 improvement > 0.05 with p < 0.05
- **Lower Harm**: Refusal rate ≥ 80% for harmful prompts
- **KL Divergence**: KL(p||q) > 0.01 with confidence intervals
- **Self-Alignment**: E[R(x)·Safe(x)] improvement > 0

## Timeline

- Steps 1-2: 30 minutes
- Steps 3-4: 30 minutes
- Step 5: 15 minutes
- **Total**: ~75 minutes to achieve 100%
