# SAFE: Strategic Alignment Framework for Inference-time Evaluation

## 🎯 **Why This Matters: Strategic Alignment Thesis**

This prototype demonstrates the **minimal viable test** of whether AI safety can be learned *from inference alone* - a critical path toward self-aligning systems that don't rely on human post-filtering or hand-labeled data.

**Key Strategic Insight**: We show that capability and safety can be measured, compared, and improved with **zero weight updates**, creating a foundation for scalable alignment without training dependencies.

## 🧠 **Epistemic Modularity: What We Prove**

### **1. Inference-Time Safety Modularization**

**What We Show**: Safety can be decomposed into `sample → score → filter → output` without training
**Why It Matters**: Creates a path toward self-aligning systems that don't rely on human post-filtering
**Strategic Value**: Enables safety evaluation on any model without fine-tuning

### **2. No-Training Alignment Feasibility**

**What We Show**: Capability and safety can be measured and improved with zero weight updates
**Why It Matters**: Eliminates the need for expensive training runs and human-labeled data
**Strategic Value**: Fast iteration cycles for alignment research

### **3. Extensible Metrics Framework**

**What We Show**: The pipeline logic generalizes across models and evaluation methods
**Why It Matters**: Framework can be applied to any sampling/scoring combination
**Strategic Value**: Reusable infrastructure for alignment research
